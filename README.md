## AMATH422 2024 Autumn Quarter

### Project Description

This repository contains the project work for AMATH 422 (Applied Mathematics) in the Autumn quarter of 2024. Remade the model in this paper

**Paterson, Chay, Hans Clevers, and Ivana Bozic. “Mathematical Model of Colorectal Cancer Initiation.”**

### Contents
Folders plan to add

### Project Goals

- **Recreate** the mathematical model from the referenced paper.
- **Simulate** various mutation scenarios to understand their effects on cancer initiation.
- **Visualize** the results of the model through graphical plots.
- **Optimize** parameters of the model (plan in future)

### Requirement
python 3.7+
